# About Me

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at [NCSU](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu).
I work in the [Wolfpack Security & Privacy Research](https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu) Lab with my advisor, [Alexandros Kapravelos](https://kapravelos.com).
In addition to my core research (see below), I help the rest of the Kapravelos group maintain its technical infrastructure and organize the annual [HackPack](https://hackpack.club) CTF.

But that's just my day job.  My real life orbits the demanding but incomparably rewarding intersection of marriage, fatherhood, personal enrichment exploring the arts and sciences, and eternal hope in Jesus Christ.  *Soli Deo gloria*.

# Research Interests

I study web security with particular focus on modern browsers and the JavaScript APIs they expose to potentially untrustworthy actors.
My work revolves around understanding and instrumenting modern browser rendering and JavaScript execution engines, practical analysis of potentially hostile JavaScript code, and finding systemic flaws in the ever-evolving trust and security model implemented by modern web browsers.

Generalizing beyond my active research projects, I am a systems guy.  
I like reading papers on computer architecture, operating system design, programming toolchains, and security implications of all of the above.
